Help
-A ext:analyzer
Files with the named extension should be analyzed with the specified class
-a on/off
Allow or disallow leading wildcards in a search
-B url
Base URL of the user Information provider. Default: "http://www.opensolaris.org/viewProfile.jspa?username="
-C
Print per project percentage progress information(I/O extensive, since one read through dir structure is made before indexing, needs -v, otherwise it just goes to the log)
-c /path/to/ctags
Path to Exuberant Ctags from http://ctags.sf.net by default takes the Exuberant Ctags in PATH.
-D
Store history cache in a database (needs the JDBC driver in the classpath, typically derbyclient.jar or derby.jar)
-d /path/to/data/root
The directory where OpenGrok stores the generated data
-e
Economical - consumes less disk space. It does not generate hyper text cross reference files offline, but will do so on demand - which could be sightly slow.
-H
Generate history cache for all repositories
-h /path/to/repository
just generate history cache for the specified repos (absolute path from source root)
-I pattern
Only files matching this pattern will be examined (supports wildcards, example: -I *.java -I *.c)
-i pattern
Ignore the named files or directories (supports wildcards, example: -i *.so -i *.dll)
-j class
Name of the JDBC driver class used by the history cache. Can use one of the shorthands "client" (org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver) or "embedded" (org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver). Default: "client"
-k /path/to/repository
Kill the history cache for the given repository and exit. Use '*' to delete the cache for all repositories.
-K
List all repository pathes and exit.
-L path
Path to the subdirectory in the web-application containing the requested stylesheet. The following factory-defaults exist: "default", "offwhite" and "polished"
-l on/off
Turn on/off locking of the Lucene database during index generation
-m number
The maximum words to index in a file
-N /path/to/symlink
Allow this symlink to be followed. Option may be repeated.
-n
Do not generate indexes, but process all other command line options
-O on/off
Turn on/off the optimization of the index database as part of the indexing step
-P
Generate a project for each of the top-level directories in source root
-p /path/to/default/project
This is the path to the project that should be selected by default in the web application(when no other project set either in cookie or in parameter). You should strip off the source root.
-Q on/off
Turn on/off quick context scan. By default only the first 32k of a file is scanned, and a '[..all..]' link is inserted if the file is bigger. Activating this may slow the server down (Note: this is setting only affects the web application)
-q
Run as quietly as possible
-R /path/to/configuration
Read configuration from the specified file
-r on/off
Turn on/off support for remote SCM systems
-S
Search for "external" source repositories and add them
-s /path/to/source/root
The root directory of the source tree
-T number
The number of threads to use for index generation. By default the number of threads will be set to the number of available CPUs
-t number
Default tabsize to use (number of spaces per tab character)
-U host:port
Send the current configuration to the specified address (This is most likely the web-app configured with ConfigAddress)
-u url
URL to the database that contains the history cache. Default: If -j specifies "embedded", "jdbc:derby:$DATA_ROOT/cachedb;create=true"; otherwise, "jdbc:derby://localhost/cachedb;create=true"
-V
Print version and quit
-v
Print progress information as we go along
-W /path/to/configuration
Write the current configuration to the specified file (so that the web application can use the same configuration
-w webapp-context
Context of webapp. Default is /source. If you specify a different name, make sure to rename source.war to that name.
-X url:suffix
URL Suffix for the user Information provider. Default: ""
-z number
depth of scanning for repositories in directory structure relative to source root
